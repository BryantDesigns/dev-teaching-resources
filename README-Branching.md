# Introduction to Branching

Branching is a core concept in Git that allows multiple developers to work on different features, bug fixes, or tasks simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. This README explains the basics of branching and how it can help streamline the development process.

## What is a Branch?

A branch in Git is a separate line of development. It enables you to work on different features or fixes in isolation, without affecting the main codebase.

## Common Branch Types

- **Main/Master:** The main branch where the stable code lives. All completed work eventually merges back into this branch.
- **Feature Branch:** Used to develop new features or functionality.
- **Bugfix Branch:** Created to fix bugs in the code.
- **Hotfix Branch:** A quick fix branch for critical issues in production.
- **Release Branch:** A branch used to prepare for a release.
