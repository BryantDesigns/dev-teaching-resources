# Avoiding Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when different changes to the same part of a file are made on different branches. While conflicts are sometimes unavoidable, here are some strategies to minimize them:

## Strategies to Avoid Conflicts

1. **Regularly Pull Changes:** Frequently pull the latest changes from the main branch into your working branch.
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
2. **Communicate:** Coordinate with your team about who is working on what parts of the codebase.
3. **Small, Focused Commits:** Make small, focused commits that are easier to review and less likely to conflict with others' work.
4. **Feature Toggles:** Use feature toggles to enable or disable incomplete features, reducing the need for long-lived branches.

## Branching Strategy

Adopt a branching strategy like Git Flow, GitHub Flow, or Trunk-based development to reduce conflicts.
