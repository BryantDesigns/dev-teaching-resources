# Pull Request Guidelines

Pull requests (PRs) are an essential part of the code review process. This guide provides best practices for creating and reviewing PRs.

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Ensure Your Branch is Up-to-Date:** Pull the latest changes from the main branch into your feature branch.
    \```bash
    git pull origin main
    \```
2. **Run Tests:** Ensure all tests pass before submitting the PR.
3. **Write a Descriptive Title:** The PR title should clearly describe the change.
4. **Provide a Detailed Description:** Include what changes were made, why they were made, and how they were tested.
5. **Request Reviewers:** Assign the appropriate team members to review the PR.

## Reviewing a Pull Request

1. **Understand the Context:** Read the PR description and related issues or tasks.
2. **Review Code Quality:** Check for code clarity, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
3. **Test the Changes:** If applicable, pull the branch locally and test the changes.
4. **Provide Constructive Feedback:** Offer suggestions or improvements, and ask questions if something is unclear.
5. **Approve or Request Changes:** If the PR meets all criteria, approve it. If not, request changes with clear explanations.

## Final Steps

- After approval, the PR should be merged by the person who created it or a designated team member.
- Delete the branch after merging to keep the repository clean.
