# Testing Guidelines

Testing is crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the codebase. This guide provides an overview of our testing practices.

## Types of Tests

1. **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions or components in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests:** Test how different parts of the application work together.
3. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Test the entire application flow from start to finish.
4. **Performance Tests:** Measure the performance of specific parts of the application.
5. **Security Tests:** Identify potential security vulnerabilities.

## Writing Tests

- **Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern:** Arrange your test data, act on the code, and assert the expected outcome.
- **Write Clear and Descriptive Test Names:** The test name should clearly describe what is being tested and the expected outcome.
- **Test Edge Cases:** Ensure that your tests cover edge cases and error conditions.

## Running Tests

- **Run All Tests Before Committing:**
    \```bash
    npm test
    \```
- **Automate Tests in CI/CD:** Ensure that all tests are run automatically as part of the continuous integration (CI) process.

## Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage, but quality is more important than quantity. Focus on testing critical paths and edge cases.
