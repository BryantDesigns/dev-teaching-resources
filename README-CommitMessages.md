# Commit Message Guidelines

Clear and consistent commit messages are essential for understanding the history of the project. Here are some guidelines:

## Structure of a Commit Message

1. **Title (short summary):** Limit the title to 50 characters. Capitalize the first word, and do not end with a period.
2. **Body (detailed description):** If needed, provide more context in the body. Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
3. **Footer (optional):** Reference any issues or tasks associated with the commit.

## Examples

\```text
Fix typo in README

Corrected the spelling of "intructions" to "instructions" in the README file.

Resolves: #123
\```

## Best Practices

- **Use the Imperative Mood:** ("Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
- **Be Concise:** Limit the title to 50 characters and the body to 72 characters per line.
- **Separate Logical Changes:** Commit one logical change at a time, and avoid mixing unrelated changes.
- **Reference Issues/Tasks:** Link to relevant issues or tasks to provide context.
